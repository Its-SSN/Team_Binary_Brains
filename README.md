Problem Statement- Implement possible innovative solutions to detect and curb the problem of microsleep hence reducing road accidents caused by them.

Description- A countless number of people drive on the highway day and night. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers and people traveling long-distance suffer from lack of sleep and hence encounter microsleep while driving. Due to which it becomes very dangerous to drive.The majority of accidents happen due to the microsleep and drowsiness of the driver. 
So, to prevent these accidents we will build a web application integrated with Python, OpenCV, and Keras which will detect and alert the driver when he is in the state of microsleep.

Tech-Stack used- 
1.HTML
2.CSS
3.Javascript
4.Flask
5.MySQL
6.Bootstrap
7.Tensorflow/Keras
8.Pytorch
9.OpenCV
10.Numpy
11.Pandas

Features-
1.Authorization and Authentication of drivers.
2.Face and eye-detection using OpenCV.
3.Drowsiness detection using Keras/Pytorch.
4.Visual assessment plots to track microsleep.
5.CRUD operations controlled by admin.
